pip-check
=========

pip-check gives you a quick overview of all installed packages and their
update status. Under the hood it calls ``pip list --outdated --format=columns``
and transforms it into a more user friendly table.

Installation::

    pip install pip-check

The last version that runs on Python 2.7 or 3.4 is v2.5.2. Install it with::

    pip install pip-check==2.5.2

Usage::

    $ pip-check -h
    usage: pip-check [-h] [-a] [-c PIP_CMD] [-l] [-r] [-f] [-H] [-u] [-U]

      -c PIP_CMD, --cmd PIP_CMD
                            The pip executable to run. Default: `pip`
      -l, --local           Show only virtualenv installed packages.

                            installed packages.
